FSDEV Cavendish MediaWiki Theme
================

This is a slight hack of the Mozilla `Cavendish' MediaWiki theme for
MediaWiki 1.16. Basically, I made it so that the sidebar is --fixed-width
while the rest of the page is dynamic width.-- It also works on Internets
Exploder version 7.

Note that I have reverted to an earlier version which works better with IE7. The dynamic width bit is a lie right now.

Please feel free to fork this to your heart's content, hack it, love it,
heck, you might even want to use it some day.

All the other default MediaWiki themes are in this repo. This makes it quite
easy to grab this theme: just rename your skins directory and then clone
this repo as your new skins directory. After possible file permissions fixes,
you should be good to go.

Licensing
-------------

Whatever. I don't remember the original license, but this is under that
original license. Probably the Mozilla Public License, but honestly...
meh, don't care.
